=============================
The Makefile worked fine!.  Was able to use ps2pdf to convert the resultant 
lionc.ps without any problems.

This directory contains the source code for the John Lion's "A commentary on the
Sixth Edition UNIX Operating System". This form of the document was published
on the USENET alt.folklore.computers newsgroup in May 1994. A Makefile was 
added more recently.

  Preface 

  This book is an attempt to explain in
  detail the nucleus of one of the most
  interesting computer operating systems
  to appear in recent years.

  It is the UNIX Time-sharing System,
  which runs on the larger models of
  Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP11
  computer system, and was developed by
  Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell
  Laboratories. It was first announced to
  the world in the July, 1974 issue of
  the ``Communications of the ACM''.
